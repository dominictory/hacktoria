## Investigation

Based on the key details of the contract, we can confirm the following points:

- The attack occurred in a park
- The park contained benches, bins, bushes, trees, paths, and at least one adjacent building
- The park is frequented by joggers
- The park is located in San Francisco

Using this information, we can narrow down the search to local parks that contain the items above. However, we cannot be certain that the attack occurred in Northwest Berkeley, as the victim could have strayed from this area during her jog. That said, let us observe the Northwest Berkeley area as a starting point:

Using Google Maps to search for the area, a convenient border is drawn which should assist in the search. Switching to satellite, we straight away have a detailed view of where the victim originated from. Immediately, 'Cedar Rose Park' stands out, and we have an area of interest to search:

From satellite view, we can make out all the items listed above from the image. To confirm the finding, we should check for any street-level photos:

This matches! We understand the flag format is local-park-name-dirty-mud-path, and from the map we can see the path is called 'Ohlone Greenway'. We can then deduce the following potential flag:

cedar-rose-park-ohlone-greenway

Card collected.
